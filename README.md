# GoodLinks - Alfred workflow

An Alfred workflow for searching and adding links in [GoodLinks](https://goodlinks.app).

## Usage

### Search GoodLinks

Search for a link in GoodLinks using the keyword `gls`. Optionally enter text to filter the results. Use `↩` to open the link in GoodLinks. 

Note: The first time search is invoked, Alfred may take several seconds to display the results. After that, the results are intelligently cached and updated by Alfred, and should appear immediately. 

### Add URL to GoodLinks

Add a link to GoodLinks using the [Universal Action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/universal-actions/), or use the keyword `gl` to add a link from the frontmost browser.

By default, links are added via GoodLinks "quick save". Hold the `⌥` key to edit the link info in GoodLinks.

## Configuration

The workflow provides configuration for keywords and cache duration.
